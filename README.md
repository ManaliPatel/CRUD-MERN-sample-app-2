## CRUD-MERN-sample-app-2

- Followed this video for this project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CqJlxBYj-M
- Express and MongoDB as backend and React as frontend.
- I wrote cypress tests and Jest tests afterwards.

## Installed libraries:

- nodemon : monitor any changes in your code and automatically restarts
- dotenv : loads environment variable from a `.env` file into `process.env`.
- express : web application framework for node
- mongoDB Atlas: allows you to host and see MongoDB database
- axios: allows you to create HTTP request and send it from frontend to backend

## to start localhost

```
npm install > npm start (to start frontend)
cd backend > npm install > npx nodemon server (to start backend)

```
